# Eccy

:::danger WARNING

projects you value.

:::warning DOCUMENTATION
The Eccy documentation is currently very barebones. The information is probably
(mostly) accurate but since Eccy is still experimental and the API evolves
quickly, some parts may be outdated, and a lot of in-depth information is still
missing entirely.

Feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/woubuc/eccy/pulls) to help
complete the documentation.
